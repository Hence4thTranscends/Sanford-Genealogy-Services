								<h2 class="major">Our Work</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Here at Sanford Genealogy Services we are professionals who research family histories and lineage. Our work involves various tasks aimed at uncovering, documenting, preserving & presenting ancestry and family connections of individuals or families. Here are some key aspects of our work: </p> <br>

									1. Research and Data Collection<br><br />
									
										Archival Research: We spend significant time in libraries, archives, and online databases to collect records such as birth, marriage, death certificates, census records, immigration documents, military records, and more.<br><br />
										Oral Histories: We may conduct interviews with family members to gather stories, traditions, and personal recollections that can provide context and fill gaps in written records.<br><br />
										Historical Context: We know that understanding the historical, social, and cultural contexts of the times and places where ancestors lived is crucial as it helps in interpreting records accurately and understanding the conditions that affected their lives.<br><br />
									
									2. Analysis and Documentation<br><br />
									
										Record Analysis: Here at Sanford Genealogy Services we analyze documents to extract relevant information and establish connections between individuals. This involves verifying the authenticity and reliability of sources.<br><br />
										Building Family Trees: We create detailed family trees or pedigree charts that visually represent familial relationships and lineages.<br><br />
										Documentation and Citations: We provide proper documentation and citation of sources are essential to maintain the credibility and accuracy of our genealogical work.<br><br />
									
									3. Problem-Solving and Validation<br><br />
									
										Brick Walls: We often encounter challenges or "brick walls" where records are scarce or non-existent. We use various ranges of problem-solving skills and alternative research strategies to overcome these obstacles.<br><br />
										Validation: We here at Sanford Genealogy Services are committed and know the importance to ensuring the accuracy of presenting genealogical information. We always cross-reference multiple sources and use third-party DNA testing where applicable to validate our findings.<br><br />
									
									4. Technology and Tools<br><br />
									
										Software: We use specialized software to organize and manage data, create charts, and share information.<br><br />
										Online Databases: Websites like Ancestry.com, FamilySearch.org, and others provide access to vast collections of records and resources.<br><br />
										DNA Testing: Genetics is an increasingly important tool. We interpret DNA test results to find biological relatives and trace ancestral origins.<br><br />
									
									5. Education and Training<br><br />
									
										Continuous Learning: Here at Sanford Genealogy Services we must stay updated on new research methodologies, technologies, and available resources. We pursue formal education and certifications.<br><br />
										Workshops and Conferences: We attend conferences, workshops, and seminars that helps us network with other professionals and learn about the latest developments in the field.<br><br />
									
									6. Client Services<br><br />
									
										Custom Research: Many of us work as consultants, offering custom research services to clients who want to learn more about their family history.<br><br />
										Reporting: We prepare detailed reports and narratives for clients, often including charts, family histories, and other documentation.<br><br />
										Education and Guidance: We may also teach classes, lead workshops, or provide guidance to individuals conducting their own research in the near future.<br><br />
									
									7. Ethical Considerations<br><br />
									
										Privacy: Ultimately we here at Sanford Genealogy Services are respecting of the privacy of living individuals and our handling of these sensitive information we present and know this to be paramount.<br><br />
										Cultural Sensitivity: We always approach each case with an awareness of and respect for cultural differences and traditions of its times.<br><br><br />
									
									Overall, the work we do here is very meticulous, involving a combination of research skills, historical knowledge, analytical thinking, problem solving, and a passion for uncovering and preserving family histories.</p><br><br />
